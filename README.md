# GhostSharp

This is a [wrapper](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-an-api-wrapper-and-how-do-i-write-one/) around the [Ghost API](https://api.ghost.org), a RESTful JSON API built into the core of the [Ghost blogging platform](https://ghost.org/).

I like Ghost, and it's been awhile since I really flexed my C# muscles, so I decided to do this as an exercise. I don't even have a use for it yet, so if you do please [let me know](https://twitter.com/GrantWinney)! Check out the [official docs](https://api.ghost.org/docs) and read about [my own experience](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-the-ghost-api/) too.

***(For now, this wrapper only implements the `GET` method on the various API endpoints.)***

## Usage

### Accessing Public API

If you only need to access the public API (assuming it's enabled on the site), all you need is the URL of the site and the client id and secret. 

```csharp
var url = "https://your-site.com"
var clientId = "ghost-frontend";
var clientSecret = "1234abcd6789";

var auth = new GhostAPI(url, clientId, clientSecret);

// get a collection of posts
var postResponse = auth.GetPosts();
var posts = postResponse.Posts;

// get a particular post, based on the slug
var post = auth.GetPostBySlug(PostSlug);
```

### Accessing Private API, Need an Auth Token

If the public API is disabled in the site settings, or you need to create or delete data, you'll need an authorization token.

You can get an authorization token by supplying a username and password in the constructor, and it'll be used in subsequent requests.

```csharp
var url = "https://your-site.com"
var clientId = "ghost-frontend";
var clientSecret = "1234abcd6789";
var username = "youremail@somewhere.com";
var password = "some-password";

var auth = new GhostAPI(url, clientId, clientSecret, username, password);

var post = auth.GetPostBySlug(PostSlug);
```

### Accessing Private API, Use an Existing Auth Token

If you already have an auth token, you can just supply that:

```csharp
var url = "https://your-site.com"
var token = "some-auth-token";

var auth = new GhostAPI(url, token);

var post = auth.GetPostBySlug(PostSlug);
```

## Versioning

This wrapper is written around v1.14.0 of the API, currently the latest version. If they update the API in the future, I'll most likely create a tag for the previous release, before updating to the newest one.

## Running the Tests

The tests are setup to run against an actual instance of the Ghost blog, with its public API enabled.

The "GhostSharpTests" class, which contains the tests, is a partial class. The other part of the class is in the "GhostSharpTestsSetup.cs" file. Find the empty `const` fields and fill in the missing data, and then the tests should run okay.

## Implementation Details

### Including Author in the Response

By default, when requesting a post with the Ghost API, you get the author id as a single JSON field named "Author". If you choose to include all info about the author (by adding `?include=author` to the query string), then it adds a JSON block, also named "Author". 

That caused a problem for me, since [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/) needs a matching class to deserialize the response to, and you can't have a single class with an "Author" property that is both an `int` *and* an `Author` class.

To get around this shortcoming, I automatically include full author information. This could result in more data being sent back then necessary - especially if, for instance, you make a request for 300 posts at once and you're the only author on your blog. It's the best I could come up with for now though.

### Ghost Query Language (GQL)

The Ghost API lets you filter results by using their own syntax, called [Ghost Query Language](https://github.com/TryGhost/GQL). [Read the full specs here](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/5604).

GQL might be a little buggy, or else their API doesn't support it completely, as I wasn't able to specify multiple filters when calling the API directly from Postman. Trying an `OR` combination only seemed to apply the last filter, while an `AND` combination returned an error:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "The request failed validation.",
            "context": "Error parsing filter",
            "errorType": "ValidationError"
        }
    ]
}
```

Just be aware that if you set a value for any of the `xxxxQueryParams.Filter` properties, you may not get the results that you expect.
